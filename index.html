        <h1>Snippets</h1>
        <p>Ever walk past people and catch just a snippet of their conversation? Most of the time it's simple, but every now and then, the snippet you hear makes you wonder what they're talking about, what twists and turns the conversation must have taken to lead them to that statement you just heard. This is a project to store, track, and analyse these snippets.</p>
